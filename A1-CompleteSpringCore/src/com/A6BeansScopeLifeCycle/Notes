Bean Scopes: in Spring
Scope referes to the life cycle of a bean. How long does the bean live?
Howmany instances will be created, and how the bean is shared in the Spring Environment 

The default scope for a bean is Singleton: means spring container creates only one instance of the bean 
it is cashed in the memory and all requests to the getBean() will return the same SHARED bean.
there is only one bean and every one will share it

we can explicitly define the bean scope using the scope="" attribute
