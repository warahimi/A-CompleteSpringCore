DI:
Objective type dependencies: are just helper objects / other objects needed by our class to perform its operations
instead of us making the object and inject dependencies Spring framework will do that for us, and give us a ready to use object

there are a lot in Injection methods
1- Constructor Injection
2- Setter Injection


Container gives us a fully assembled bean/object (with all dependencies injected)
