IoC:
Spring provides us an Object Factory our app can talk to the Spring Object Factory and ask for Objects/beans
Spring Object Factory will give us the apropraite implementation object base on Configuration file / Annotation 
this make our app configurable.

The primary functions of Spring Containers:
1- Creates and Manages object (IoC)
2- Inject object`s dependency (DI)

There are 3 ways of Configuring Spring Container:
1- XML config file (legacy, but most legacy apps still use this)
2- Java Annotation (Modern)
3- Java Source Code (Modern)  // we can gid rid of all config files using this technique


Steps:
1- Configure the Spring Beans
2- Configure Spring Container (ApplicationContext)
3- Retrieve Beans from Spring Container and use
